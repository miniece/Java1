Hi!

My name is Minnie and my pronouns are she/they!

My major is Software Enginnering (the best major).

I am currently a Software Developer Apprentice at Aptiv, which is an automotive tech company. 
As well as going to school full-time, and a never-ending list of things I enjoy and hobbies I pick up.

I hope to learn valuable skills as I know Java is a widely known language and there is a member on my team who uses Java,
so it will be nice to finally be able to understand his code :P

I love video games! I hope that when I transfer, I can have a concentration in Game Design.
I hope to make my own video game one day but we'll see. I also attended a C# bootcamp that
my job sent me to so I'm not new to code but am currently learning multiple languages so this shall be fun.

Looking forward to your class!
